# Game of life
The script game_of_life.py implements the Game Of Life from John Conway. It is written in Python and requires Pygame to be installed:

```
pip3 install pygame
```

Using the left click of the mouse, one can add or remove cells. The mouse wheel allows to zoom in or zoom out.
The button "step" allows to run one iteration of the game whereas the play/pause buttons allow to play the game continuously and stop it respectively.
